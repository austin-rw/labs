This lab demonstrates EIGRP connectivity between one office site in the dallas metro area to a smaller branch office site in another. 
The two sites are connected via a metro ethernet circuit. Both networks exist in AS 100. The core switch pair in dallas servers as l3 
gateways for vlans 10, 20, and 90 using hsrp. 1a serves as primary for vlans 10 and 20 and 1b is primary for vlan 90.
